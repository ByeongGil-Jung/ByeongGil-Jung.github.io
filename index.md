I am currently a M.S student at [Artificial Intelligence Research Lab](https://air.korea.ac.kr) at Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

I specialize in the research and development of anomaly detection methodologies using artificial intelligence technology. Notably, I have experience effectively completing tasks such as an automatic quality control for manufacturing products and malicious behavior detection based on system log data.
